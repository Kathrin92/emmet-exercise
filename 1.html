Emmet is a plugin for most text editors. Instead of writing a full html-tag with css-classnames yourself, Emmet uses shortcuts.

Check out emmet.io and you'll find a lot of ways to use abbreviations in your workflow. In the following exercises try to rebuild an html-structure with just one command.

Emmet examples:

article>h1{hello world}+p*2>lorem

ul>li{item $}*5

nav>a[href="/link$"]*3+a.active[href="/link4"]

Try to rebuild this with one emmet command:
<header>
  <h1></h1>
  <h2></h2>
</header>
